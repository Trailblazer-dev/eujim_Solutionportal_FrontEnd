# Eujim Graduate Engagement Platform Frontend

A modern, responsive, and accessible web application for the Eujim Graduate Engagement Platform, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, and Lucide Icons. This platform connects graduates, employers, and administrators, providing dashboards, job search, profile management, and more.

## Features
- **Role-based Dashboards:** Separate layouts and navigation for graduates, employers, and admins.
- **Responsive & Accessible UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS v4 and a unified design system for a seamless experience on all devices.
- **Modern Tooling:** Uses Vite for fast development, TypeScript for type safety, and ESLint for code quality.
- **Component Library:** Reusable components (Card, Button, Header, etc.) for consistent UI/UX.
- **Mock Data & Placeholders:** Easily extendable with real backend integration.
- **Admin Tools:** Manage employers, graduates, analytics, and settings (with extensible placeholders).
